#### Write a program that asks the user to guess a number between 0 and 20. Keep track of the number of tries it takes the user to guess the number. If the user guesses correctly, tell them "Good job, you guessed the correct number in x number of tries.” 

##### Algorithm:
1. Generate a random number between 0 and 20 (see Lecture 10)
2. Initialize counter = 0.
3. Prompt the user to enter a number.
4. Increment the counter.
5. Check if user guessed correctly.
6. If TRUE, display appropriate message. If FALSE, go back to step 3.
