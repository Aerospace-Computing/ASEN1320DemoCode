## Instruction for Pair Programming

### Ask for help by posting a chat or raising a hand anytime.  Come back to the main meeting if you complete the tasks.

### 1. Everyone
- Introduce yourself to your classmate(s).
- Create an account and log into https://repl.it/login. You can authorize it with your gmail.
- Decide on who is going to be the LEAD for today's pair programming session. 
- The others will be designated as the OTHERS for the session.

### 2. LEAD
- Create a new Repl by clicking "+New Repl" button on the top left. Make sure you choose C++ as language. This will set up a default **main.cpp** in your Repl folder
- Click on "Share" on the top right, and copy a link for your Repl and post it in a private Zoom chat to the OTHERS.
- Go to https://github.com/Aerospace-Computing/ASEN1320DemoCode/blob/master/Week5/sum2D_template.cpp
- Cut and past the code from sum2D_template.cpp to **main.cpp** in your Repl folder. 

### 2. OTHERS
- Make sure you can send private chats among the LEAD and OTHERS on Zoom  
- Go to https://github.com/Aerospace-Computing/ASEN1320DemoCode/blob/master/Week5/sum2D_template.cpp
- Look for the LEAD's Repl link sent via a private Zoom chat, and open the Repl page. Refresh your brower frequently. 

### 3. Everone
- Start pair programing! Refresh your brower frequently if you have issues with viewing the code realtime.
- The first task is to write some code to compute the row total using nested for-loops (see the C++ comment "// Compute row total" in sum2D_template.cpp)
- The second task is to write some code to compute the column total using nested for-loops (see the C++ comment "// Compute column total" in sum2D_template.cpp)
