## Instruction for Pair Programming

### Ask for help by posting a private chat to the instructor anytime.

### 1. Everyone
- Introduce yourself to your classmate(s).
- Create an account and log in to https://repl.it/login. You can authorize it with your gmail.
- Decide on who is going to be the LEAD for today's pair progrramming session. 
- The rest of Breakout room members will be designated as OTHERS for today's pair progrramming session.

### 2. LEAD
- Create a new Repl in C++. It will set up a default **main.cpp** in your Repl folder
- Click on Share on the top right, and copy a link of your Repl and post it as a private chat on Zoom to OTHERS.
- Go to https://github.com/Aerospace-Computing/ASEN1320DemoCode/blob/master/Week5/sum2D_template.cpp
- Cut and past the code from sum2D_template.cpp to **main.cpp** in your Repl folder. 

### 2. OTHERS
- Make sure you can send private chats among LEAD and OTHERS on Zoom  
- Go to https://github.com/Aerospace-Computing/ASEN1320DemoCode/blob/master/Week5/sum2D_template.cpp
- Grab the link to LEAD's Repl sent via a Zoom private chat, and open the LEAD's Repl page. Refresh your brower frequently. 

### 3. Everone
- Shart pair-programing. Refresh your brower frequently. 
- The first task is to write some code to compute the row total using nested for-loops (see the C++ comment "// Compute row total")
- The second task is to write some code to compute the column total using nested for-loops (see the C++ comment "// Compute column total")
